# Wegodev Test - Chuck Norris Jokes Generator Using React JS as Frontend.
This project aimed as first test from Wegodev for Frontend Developers who want to contribute or work together in their project: Distributed Online Reseller System.

## Run It Locally
To run this project locally simply clone this repo and because of this project was created with `yarn` so I highly recommended to install the `package.json` using `yarn` as well.
Since, there will be some issues if `yarn` and `npm` mixed in one project.
